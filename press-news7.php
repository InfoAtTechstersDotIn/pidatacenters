                    <!-- <h3>Economic Times featured a recent interview of Kalyan Muppaneni about India achieving the goal of $5 trillion economy</h3> -->
                    <p class="date">03-Feb-2020, Monday</p>
                    <p>In October last year, Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister of India acknowledged the Prime Minister’s vision of transforming India into a $5 trillion economy and a global economic powerhouse by 2024-25, as “challenging” but “realizable.”</p>
                    <p>Since then many people from different professions and backgrounds have shared their views and comments on this vision. While few of them have supported this audacious goal, the remaining mass has already concluded this as an impossible task. But interestingly, not many of them have recommended any solid measures that the country should take up in order to achieve this goal. However, after Mrs. Sitharaman presented the Budget 2020 last Saturday, Mr. Piyush Goyal, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry said that the budget will prepare India to become a $5 trillion economy.</p>
                    <p>Kalyan explained how inclusive growth from rural-India will be one critical factor for the country in achieving the audacious goal of $5 trillion economy.

Kalyan highlighted the importance of bridging the current socio-economic gap between the rural and urban parts of the country in the interview.</p>
