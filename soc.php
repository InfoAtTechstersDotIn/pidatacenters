        <h3>Why <span style="color: #7BBC42;font-weight:400;">SOC?</span></h3>
        <p>In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are a constant concern for businesses of all sizes. From ransomware attacks to data breaches, the potential consequences of a security incident can be severe and far-reaching. One of the primary challenges of cybersecurity is the constantly evolving nature of threats. Hackers and cybercriminals are constantly developing new tactics and techniques to evade detection and compromise systems, which means that businesses must stay vigilant and take proactive measures to protect themselves. That is why having a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) is so important for any organization.</p>
