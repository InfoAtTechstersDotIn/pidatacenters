      <p dir="ltr">Positive Work Environment: Organizations today are goal driven entities. They strive to perform the best and make the most out of every thing with an end goal of making profits , which is made possible only with the contribution of human capital it has. The sense of belongingness and responsibility is what should make the people perform beyond their limits for accomplishing the organizational goals.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">There are always individual goals and the goals at an organizational level that are to be accomplished.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">So this brings us to the question that how will an employee, who also has his individual goals give a higher importance to the organizational goals and perform his best in doing so.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">This can happen when the organization takes care of the employees as they take care of every thing else. It is to be made sure that the employees are happy at their workplace.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">According a meta-analysis of 225 academic studies, done by Sonja Lyubomirsky and team, it was found that happy employees have, on average, 31% higher productivity; their sales are 37% higher; their creativity is three times higher¹.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">What makes an employee happy is not just the monetary benefit out of his/her work but the work itself along with the work culture. It is on every person working for the organization to put efforts in making it the best place to work, for each of his colleagues, sub ordinates, officials and of course himself.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">What constitutes a best work place, never has horizons and can never limit to few points. But many researches say that a positive work environment is what every employee dreams of.</p>
      <h2 dir="ltr">Let us double click on ‘positive work environment’.</h2>
      <h3 dir="ltr">What It is not:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">This is not mere ‘head nodding’ or ‘acceptance to every act of the employee’. Neither is to never say no.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is not about ‘no rules and no discipline’.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is not just about a ‘high pay’ and more team outings</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 dir="ltr">But:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about the happiness and satisfaction an employee gets stepping in for work each day.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about the smile which is passed on and little gestures to make each other happy.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about saying that you are wrong in a right way, the way which would inspire the employee to give his/her best and stretch beyond his/her limits in doing so.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about saying no, but in a way which would make the employee realize the importance of the situation.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about rules and discipline which an employee would love to follow.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about a good pay , with a meaningful work.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about a team outing , with lot of interaction.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about treating each other with trust, respect,gratitude and integrity.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about leadership, but not authority.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is not just about an appraisal, which would show up as incentives or a bonus, but a little appreciation for the work.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about encouraging and inspiring to work.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about openness to learn from your surroundings.</li>
        <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is about acceptance with a responsibility towards each others growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 dir="ltr">The role of leadership : </h3>
      <p dir="ltr">“Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, its amazing what they can accomplish. “ – Sam Walton.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Leadership is not about being authoritative but about leading by example. People follow them and their deeds. They should give a positive inspiration to many young brains and great talents.They should realize the importance of the employees individual goals and help them achieve those within the workplace limits. This would make them reach their personal goals and never ends there, but also helps accomplish the organizational goals to have great teams at work , giving the maximum productivity. The more approachable and responsive the leaders are, the more is the employee engagement and there by productivity².</p>
      <p dir="ltr">³Research shows that when people work with a positive mind-set, performance on nearly every level—productivity, creativity, engagement—improves.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">To conclude, be positively energetic and spread the aura. All you see then, is that no goal would remain unfulfilled at any level, be it for an individual or for an organization.</p>

      <!--<p>It’s been seven years since I took that supposedly, out of mind call, one fine afternoon of early March 2015. Sitting at the café of a global conglomerate at DLF Gurgaon, I picked that call from a head-hunter and after I hung that barely 10 min call, I chose not to sign on the dotted line of that lucrative offer. Not sure what egged me then to take that daring call, but I did. </p>
                      <p>In this time and age when everybody seems to be on a constant lookout for change in almost anything, the fact that I managed to beat the 7 years’ itch leading to my second long stint in a 24-year long career (Wow, it’s 24 years already!) never fails to surprise people. I started my career with a 10years’ stint and perhaps now at the closing end on career, a 7years’ and still rolling with Pi Datacenters </p>
                      <p>In fact, at times I wonder how I managed to do it, that too twice and why?</p>
                      <p>I think at the core of it is <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span>.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I want to take up a challenge</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, what I am getting into is new and I am going to make it disruptive</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am convinced with the vision</p>
                      <p> <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am not going to leave it half baked</p>
                      <p> <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am going to make it count</p>
                      <p> If my appetite for facing the unknown was what got me to take up my first job, my ever aspiration to be a part of something disruptive and historical was what propelled my decision to join Pi. If my first long stay shaped me as a professional that I am today, my stint with Pi is giving me the opportunity to shape the big dream of setting up India’s home grown hyperscale datacenter and enterprise cloud. Thanks to Kalyan Muppaneni (Founder & CEO of Pi), for showing trust in me, when things were intangible and only on papers.</p>
                      <p>  I still find myself as inquisitive to learning and exploring unventured paths, as I was on the 1st day of my career.</p>
                      <p>Today, even after all these years, I am still excited to get to work, hop into those virtual and in-person meetings, engage in interesting discussions, be challenged by situations, take the challenge head on but with respect, hand hold the new breed of professionals and most importantly continue to dream big. With Pi, I never felt like being on a job. It has been about living my personal dream and seeing it come to life. </p>
                      <p> It’s a different level of satisfaction to work with this exciting new breed of young professionals and build an ecosystem (yes,Pi is not a company but an ecosystem). This group is very Intelligent (not artificially) and humane by DNA. We are driven by a strong culture and not just revenue returns. We are aggressive in our approach, but not abrasive in behaviour. We are profitable, but without compromising on values. We do fail, but never fail to learn.</p>
                      <p> It’s a different level of satisfaction to work with this exciting new breed of young professionals and build an ecosystem (yes,Pi is not a company but an ecosystem).

We are profitable, but without compromising on values. We do fail, but never fail to learn.</p>
                      
                       <p> Over time, my role transformed from being sales focused to revenue focused. From driving people to driving behavioural transformation in people. A hair-line difference to the naked eyes, but a sea difference when seen through our lens. Times have changed, things have become more and more challenging, with higher stakes. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some great minds in the past and even today. I don’t make friends at work, but I have earned relations for life, at Pi, both at the management level and within the larger Pi’oneer community. We have worked smart and partied hard. We are constantly challenging the status quo both internally and externally to reinvent ourselves. I’ve learnt to not get defocused from the actual goal.</p> 
                      <p> When asked what makes me stay longer at a company, I kind of zero in on these 3 aspects:</p>
                      
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">1.Vision Driven Companies:</span> Being part of an organisation that is creating milestones and history is something that I just can’t let go. It started 7 years back alongside just handful other pairs of eyes and a dream. I’ve seen that dream extrapolating into a mission. There’s that sense of legacy being created and a constant reminder of how amazing it is to play a role in something great. It goes without saying that I owe it to Pi for giving me this envious opportunity to create history.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">2.Continuous Learning Opportunity:</span> I learn and discover something new every day. It’s one of the perks, I can’t let go either…… </p>
                      <p>    <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">3.Challenging Status Quo:?</span> There is a school of thought that might say, Change is Constant. I chose to be that constant and saw the change upfolding (disruptive, isn’t it?) around me. Every time there have been situations where I wanted to give up, the joy of beating the odds, being at Pi, far outweighed the reasons to look out.</p>
                      <p>To everyone who wants to give up on challenges and find short term escape routes or easier lanes, are most welcome to do so. Just remember that unless you go through fire and hammers, you won’t gold out or become a quartz. You need to be honest and prove yourself. Success and glitters would follow. Doing things that enable you to do what you want and what you’re passionate about, will do wonders to your personal as well as professional lives.</p>
                      <p>Like it’s said, “The magic always happens outside your comfort zone!”</p>
                      <p>You Win Or You Learn ∞!</p>
