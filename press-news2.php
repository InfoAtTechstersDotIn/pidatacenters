                    <p>Pi DATACENTERS today announced the re-appointment of 4 officers as part of their strategic growth plan. Pi had a stupendous run over last 14 months, at the midst of the ongoing pandemic. It acted as a catalyst for many businesses across India, handholding them to effectively adopt the strategy of migrating from inhouse legacy IT infrastructure to next generation co-location data center and cloud.</p>
                    <p>This announcement comes as part of the company’s strategic expansion plan across India. In addition, to the datacenters at Amaravati (AP) and Kochi (Kerala), the company plans to open three more datacenters in India making it a unique platform across Tier I and Tier II Indian cities.</p>
                    <p>Speaking to the media, Kalyan Muppaneni, Founder and CEO, Pi DATACENTERS said, “As the industry has been challenged to its limits in last year and half, Pi has been at the forefront in helping businesses to digitally transform. Our Uptime Institute TIER IV certified data center solutions and enterprise cloud pi-cloud, has helped enterprises, achieve the much-needed business continuity, operational excellence and significant TCO optimisation at these trying times. As part of our strategic growth plan, I am very excited to announce that we are forming a Strategic Core Council (SCC) to help execute our strategic growth roadmap. Along with me the SCC would comprise of 5 members – Manu Sharma (Chief Financial Officer), Debmalya Dey Roy (Deb) (Chief Revenue Officer), Sunder Muthevi (Chief Technology Officer) and Abhinav Kotagiri, (Director & Chief Datacenter Delivery Officer). SCC has a combined datacenter infrastructure and cloud experience of over 100 man-years from across the globe. The fully empowered SCC would focus on the core areas for the company and its growth charters around enterprise data center colocation, cloud, customer experience & advocacy, skill development, future expansions, and M&A strategies.”</p>
