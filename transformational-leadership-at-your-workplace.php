      <h3 dir="ltr">Transformational leadership is an efficient and effective handholding that enables the team to undergo a transformation and inspires them to explore the uncharted waters. Transformational leaders inspire great fidelity and confidence in their followers.</h3>
      <p dir="ltr">When to use the transformational leadership style?</p>
      <p dir="ltr">A passionate and enthusiastic leader when senses the same enthusiasm in the team, should adopt this style of leadership. The confidence that, this adoption can bring in a different dimension to the team, should drive the change in leadership style.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">It is equally important that the team trusts their leader not blindly but wisely. While it is psychologically boosting for the leader to have blind trust, it is equally his responsibility to instil wisdom in his team to choose to trust with for a right reason. This makes the team stronger and eases the path of transformation as the team willingly takes the steps seeing the spark in their leader.&nbsp; The leader’s vision is transpired and translated as the team’s vision. His abilities to express and positively influence would make it work.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Four basic qualities of the transformational leadership:</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Inspirational Motivation: &nbsp; To motivate is much beyond writing inspiring vision and mission statements for the team. It is with the leader on how he/she articulates it for the team to believe in working together for the same. He/she builds confidence, gives out positive energy and hope for an optimistic future. He/she understands the fact that purpose of doing an act is what motivates a person the most and keeps his communication well-articulated with a purpose and meaning to drive the team towards success. Engaging, precise and purposeful vision encourages the team to invest more efforts and boosts their confidence on their abilities to give the best.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Individualized Consideration: What matters the most is the level to which a leader can attend to each of his/her follower’s individual needs and act as mentor to coach the follower towards excellence. To be able to listen and empathize to the concerns shared, builds a layer of strong trust between the team and the anchor. Enabling a continuous two way communication encourages greater contributions for the individual and team betterment from every member. A focussed approach from the leader aspires and intrinsically motivates each team player to do beyond the obvious.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Intellectual Stimulation: A transformational leader nurtures and enables people who think individually and take risks in executing their ideas. The leader not only plays a key role in letting them execute but also stands as a key stimulating factor for such ideas. A level, to which the leader challenges the status quo and takes a sane level of risk, intellectually fuels each of the passionate followers. A leader who believes and sees opportunities to learn continuously, excites the team to ask questions and think deeply to find the best ways to execute any problem on the move. To simply say, a transformational leader adds new perspectives to the obvious and oblivious thoughts.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Idealized Influence:&nbsp; Ethics and values are what define a person. It is the responsibility of the leader to be the right role model to instil high morals like respect, trust, royalty, pride and behaviour at a team level. He/she should lead by example, for they are noticed and followed by generation next.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">When will the transformational leadership not be effective?</p>
      <p dir="ltr">If the team looks onto the team leader as an archetypal person, transformation leadership will not have the expected results. As the transformation is an ongoing process, there will be an expectation on the leader from the team members to put on newness of thought every day and display an igniting spark for an unending effective result. Or else, the team will fall into the monotony of situation.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Moreover, if the members have target as their prior goal and are conventionally attached to the methods of achieving the targets, this style of leadership will not be successful. If the team members are attached to the traditional setup of working and thinking, they will feel the ideas of the transformational leader are far-fetched. They will be reluctant to give in for a change or transformation.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">What is to be done? How does it work?</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Once a leader identifies the work environment and senses that use of this style will be triumphant, he uses ways to convince the team with his vision. &nbsp; The next step, which in fact never stops, is to constantly pumping the vision across the team. He/she is by their side all the time when it ebbs or flows. He/she is a sustainable support and anchor to his team. He/she always stands on the forefront till his team reaches the goal.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The leader has to maintain a sense of balance between team member’s personal interests, endeavours towards development and psychology. This helps an effective transformation to happen. Being people-oriented will lead to success and sustained progress.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The leader should learn each day and renew his ideas to avoid complacence and keep the team excited every time. A team that doesn’t believe in his leader’s abilities or distrusts his capabilities can never be transformed for better. And the only way for a leader to build trust on his/her competencies is to stay upbeat and lead by example in every facet of development.</p>

      <!--<p>It’s been seven years since I took that supposedly, out of mind call, one fine afternoon of early March 2015. Sitting at the café of a global conglomerate at DLF Gurgaon, I picked that call from a head-hunter and after I hung that barely 10 min call, I chose not to sign on the dotted line of that lucrative offer. Not sure what egged me then to take that daring call, but I did. </p>
                      <p>In this time and age when everybody seems to be on a constant lookout for change in almost anything, the fact that I managed to beat the 7 years’ itch leading to my second long stint in a 24-year long career (Wow, it’s 24 years already!) never fails to surprise people. I started my career with a 10years’ stint and perhaps now at the closing end on career, a 7years’ and still rolling with Pi Datacenters </p>
                      <p>In fact, at times I wonder how I managed to do it, that too twice and why?</p>
                      <p>I think at the core of it is <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span>.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I want to take up a challenge</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, what I am getting into is new and I am going to make it disruptive</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am convinced with the vision</p>
                      <p> <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am not going to leave it half baked</p>
                      <p> <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">TRUST</span> that, I am going to make it count</p>
                      <p> If my appetite for facing the unknown was what got me to take up my first job, my ever aspiration to be a part of something disruptive and historical was what propelled my decision to join Pi. If my first long stay shaped me as a professional that I am today, my stint with Pi is giving me the opportunity to shape the big dream of setting up India’s home grown hyperscale datacenter and enterprise cloud. Thanks to Kalyan Muppaneni (Founder & CEO of Pi), for showing trust in me, when things were intangible and only on papers.</p>
                      <p>  I still find myself as inquisitive to learning and exploring unventured paths, as I was on the 1st day of my career.</p>
                      <p>Today, even after all these years, I am still excited to get to work, hop into those virtual and in-person meetings, engage in interesting discussions, be challenged by situations, take the challenge head on but with respect, hand hold the new breed of professionals and most importantly continue to dream big. With Pi, I never felt like being on a job. It has been about living my personal dream and seeing it come to life. </p>
                      <p> It’s a different level of satisfaction to work with this exciting new breed of young professionals and build an ecosystem (yes,Pi is not a company but an ecosystem). This group is very Intelligent (not artificially) and humane by DNA. We are driven by a strong culture and not just revenue returns. We are aggressive in our approach, but not abrasive in behaviour. We are profitable, but without compromising on values. We do fail, but never fail to learn.</p>
                      <p> It’s a different level of satisfaction to work with this exciting new breed of young professionals and build an ecosystem (yes,Pi is not a company but an ecosystem).

We are profitable, but without compromising on values. We do fail, but never fail to learn.</p>
                      
                       <p> Over time, my role transformed from being sales focused to revenue focused. From driving people to driving behavioural transformation in people. A hair-line difference to the naked eyes, but a sea difference when seen through our lens. Times have changed, things have become more and more challenging, with higher stakes. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some great minds in the past and even today. I don’t make friends at work, but I have earned relations for life, at Pi, both at the management level and within the larger Pi’oneer community. We have worked smart and partied hard. We are constantly challenging the status quo both internally and externally to reinvent ourselves. I’ve learnt to not get defocused from the actual goal.</p> 
                      <p> When asked what makes me stay longer at a company, I kind of zero in on these 3 aspects:</p>
                      
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">1.Vision Driven Companies:</span> Being part of an organisation that is creating milestones and history is something that I just can’t let go. It started 7 years back alongside just handful other pairs of eyes and a dream. I’ve seen that dream extrapolating into a mission. There’s that sense of legacy being created and a constant reminder of how amazing it is to play a role in something great. It goes without saying that I owe it to Pi for giving me this envious opportunity to create history.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">2.Continuous Learning Opportunity:</span> I learn and discover something new every day. It’s one of the perks, I can’t let go either…… </p>
                      <p>    <span style="color: #012E6A;font-weight: 500;">3.Challenging Status Quo:?</span> There is a school of thought that might say, Change is Constant. I chose to be that constant and saw the change upfolding (disruptive, isn’t it?) around me. Every time there have been situations where I wanted to give up, the joy of beating the odds, being at Pi, far outweighed the reasons to look out.</p>
                      <p>To everyone who wants to give up on challenges and find short term escape routes or easier lanes, are most welcome to do so. Just remember that unless you go through fire and hammers, you won’t gold out or become a quartz. You need to be honest and prove yourself. Success and glitters would follow. Doing things that enable you to do what you want and what you’re passionate about, will do wonders to your personal as well as professional lives.</p>
                      <p>Like it’s said, “The magic always happens outside your comfort zone!”</p>
                      <p>You Win Or You Learn ∞!</p>
